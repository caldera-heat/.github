# Caldera Heat Batteries

## About Calderas

Just for fun! A [caldera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera) is a large hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber in a volcano eruption. 
You can learn more about calderas from [National Geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/calderas/).

One of our favourites is the world's largest caldera [Apolaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolaki_Caldera), or "Giant Lord", discovered as recently as 2019 by Filipina scientist Jenny Anne Barretto. Another is [Lake Toba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Toba) in Sumatra, which is the result of a supervolcanic eruption that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago.

## About Caldera Heat Batteries

Our mission is to eliminate fossil fuels by storing renewable energy as heat, ready to be used when required. You can read more on our [website](https://www.caldera.co.uk/).

## About our GitHub account

We simulate, analyse and observe all the things to do with our heat batteries. Most of our code to do that live here.
We contribute to open-source efforts (eg through working with our technical partner [octue](https://github.com/octue) but those contributions aren't here, so sorry there's not much to see!
