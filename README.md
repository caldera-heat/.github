About Caldera and our digitalisation efforts

## Calderas

Just for fun! A [Caldera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera) is a large hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber in a volcano eruption. 
You can learn more about Calderas from [National Geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/calderas/).

One of our favouuites is the world's largest caldera [Apolaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolaki_Caldera), or "Giant Lord", discovered as recently as 2019 by Filipina scientist Jenny Anne Barretto. Another is [Lake Toba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Toba) in Sumatra, which is the result of a supervolcanic eruption that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago.
